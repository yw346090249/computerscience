               This repo provides technical resources for faculty, students, and Microsoft developer advocates for use in computer science learning. The modules cover common cross-platform scenarios including mobile app dev, web dev, internet of things, data science, machine learning, and devops. Content delivery is divided into three groups: Complimentary Course Content, Tech Talks, and Workshops.</p>
               <p>Most hands-on learning focuses on how to deploy cross-platform technologies on Microsoft Azure although most of the concepts can be applied across many cloud platform solutions. Academic users can get free Azure from various programs like 
            <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/">Free Azure Trial</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.dreamspark.com/student/default.aspx">Microsoft Imagine</a>, 
            <a href="http://www.microsoftazurepass.com/">Azure Pass</a>,
            <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-dev-essentials-vs.aspx">Visual Studio Dev Essentials</a>, or
