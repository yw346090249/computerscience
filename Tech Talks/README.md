            <h1>Tech Talks</h1>
            <p><b>September 2017 release.</b> Source: <a href="https://github.com/MSFTImagine/computerscience/tree/master/Tech%20Talks">https://github.com/MSFTImagine/computerscience/tree/master/Tech%20Talks</a>.</p>
            <p>
            Tech Talks seek to inspire and educate students on topics that are emerging in the tech industry or are developer career-focused. We want them to compliment a computer science education in a more informal forum like a pre-hackathon talk, within student groups, or other visiting campus speaking or meetups. Each contains a presentation as well as speaker notes and coding demos. They are generally designed to be about 1 hour with Q&A - feel free edit them down to fit desired length. New contributions are welcome.
            </p>
